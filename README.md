Exploratory Data Analysis regarding Netflix movies, shows, and content

Objectives: Analyze Netflix's content catalogue to find trends in distribution, ratings, and regional production, as well as the differences in these factors when comparing movies and shows. 

Findings: Netflix's content seems to be relatively balanced as far as output per month. They have been steadily increasing the amount of shows they add to the platform each year, to both meet consumer demand and also to justify price increases. Around two-thirds of their media platform is the hosting of movies, the remaining amount is for hosting television shows. Across both movies and TV shows, Dramas and comedies are top genres for releases. The United States of America and eastern European countries are most prominent in media production that makes it to Netflix.
